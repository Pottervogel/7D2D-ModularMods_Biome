Biome Change: Pine Forest 2 Heathland

this modlet stands all on OCBMaurices shoulders, I did nothing but rearrange nature to look more organic.
weather is quite less rainy and foggy in heathlands and so it is here. 
It can be a bit overwhelming for people with poor eyesight or colorblindness - theres not much i can do about that, i'm terribly sorry guys.

EAC has to be disabled!
